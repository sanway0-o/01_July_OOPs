    "**Q1.** The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as in any other programming language that supports OOP principles, is to provide a structured and modular approach to designing and organizing code. OOP in Python is based on the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes, and it is built around the following core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a \"class.\" This helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works and exposes only the necessary interfaces, providing a clear separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction allows you to model real-world entities or concepts in a simplified way by defining classes that represent those entities. It involves creating abstract data types and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. This abstraction helps manage complexity and makes the code more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or superclass). It promotes code reuse, as you can extend and customize the behavior of existing classes without modifying their source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a consistent way. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and interfaces (in Python, this is achieved through duck typing).\n"

    "**Q2.** In Python, an object is a fundamental concept and a core building block of the language. Everything in Python is an object, which includes data structures, variables, functions, and even classes. An object is an instance of a class, and it can be thought of as a self-contained unit that contains both data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attributes:** Objects have attributes, which are variables that store data associated with the object. These attributes can be of various data types, including integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, or even other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods:** Objects have methods, which are functions that are defined within the class and operate on the object's data. These methods can perform various operations and provide a way to interact with and manipulate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identity:** Each object in Python has a unique identity, which is determined by its memory address. You can use the `id()` function to obtain the identity of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Type:** Objects have a type, which corresponds to the class they are instantiated from. You can use the `type()` function to determine the type of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Behavior:** Objects can exhibit behavior based on their class and the methods defined within that class. They respond to method calls and can change their internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Instantiation:** To create an object, you typically use the constructor method, often called `__init__()` in Python classes. This method initializes the object's attributes when it is created."
